Algorithms with comparison sorts can be viewed as decision trees where comparisons are held between elements.

In the decision tree, the height of the decision tree represents the worst possible number of comparisons it takes to get to the solution.

Every comparison sort has at worst an O(n log n) solution, so in order to optimize we need to sort an array differently.

These are the non-comparison sorts
