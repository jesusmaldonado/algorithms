2.1 Insertion Sort on Small Arrays in Merge Sort

2.2 BubbleSort correctness

Initiation
We have a flag which indicates sorted behavior quality, we assume it's false
Once we enter, the flag is true.

Propagation
The propagative step is to set the sorted flag back to false if any swaps occur. This means the array has changed and we need to go through it again

Termination
Once sorted, the flag will fly true, that final iteration of the loop will not generate another loop, and the

Since we've proved loop invariance, bubble sort must sort.

def bubble_sort(arr)
  sorted = false
    until sorted
      sorted = true
      (0...arr.length - 1).each do |index|
        if arr[index] > arr[index + 1]
          sorted = false
          arr[index], arr[index + 1] = arr[index + 1], arr[index]
        end
      end
    end
    arr
end
