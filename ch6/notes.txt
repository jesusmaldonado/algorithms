Heapsort

--

Creates a node representation of an array called a heap structure. A heap representation begins by representing the first eelement of the array with the next two as childen, up to a maximum of two.
The pattern is continued onto the next array.

We have methods we can call on a node

Parent(i)
return i/2

Left(i)
return 2i

Right(i)
return 2i + 1

These procedures can compute 2i in one instruction by shifting the binary representation of i by one position, 2i+ 1 by one shifting the binary representation of a number to the left and then adding 1 as the lowest bit

And a parent element can be found by shifting a bit 1 to the right.

There are two kinds of binary heaps

max-heaps
the value of a node is never greater than its parent
--so the root is the greatest value of the heap

min-heaps
a parent of a node is always smaller than both of its children
--so the root is the smallest value of the heap


height of a heap is the height of its root
the height of any node is the traversal to the shortest element
