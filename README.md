#Algorithms Practice

## A series of exercises/notes/solutions in Ruby as I work my way through [Introduction to Algorithms][algorithms].
See my implementations and notes on the various algorithms in Ruby, with solutions to the exercises.

##Exercises
[Chapter 2][chapter2]

[Divide and Conquer][divide and conquer]

##Sorting
[Insertion Sort / Linear Search / Selection O(n^2) Sort][insertion-sort-linear-search]

[Merge Sort][mergesort] O(n lgn)

[Recursive Insertion Sort][insertion-sort-recursion] O(n)

[Binary Search][binary-search] O(lg n)
